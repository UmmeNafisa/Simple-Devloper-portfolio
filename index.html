            <h3>The beginning story of the journey</h3>
            <p>You might saw Peter Parker is jumping, climbing buildings, and stopping trains. But nobody pays him a
                dime for that
                work.That's why I thought I am learning and mastering web development.
            <p> I live in Bangladesh. I have completed my graduation from "Ahsanullah University of Science &
                Technology".
                My major was in "Industrial & Production Engineering", but I was searching for my passion
                and trying to launch my career. After trying many things, I decided to change my track and become a web
                developer. I started to learn web development in February 2021. In the beginning. it was very
                challenging for me, but I didn't give up, stuck with my plan, and I will not stop until I become a web
                developer.

            <p>
                I already learned basic HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I can build any simple website. I can even teach my
                grandma
                how to make a simple website. My goal is to build 3 websites in the next month and learn advanced
                topics.
